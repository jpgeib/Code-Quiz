# Code-Quiz

This project involves creating an interactive quiz on coding, primarily utilizing Javascript functions in conjunction with HTML and some CSS for stylistic flair. It includes multiple slides for each individual question, a timer that counts down the duration of the quiz, and responds to wrong answers by depleting the allotted time.
